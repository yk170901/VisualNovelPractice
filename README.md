# VisualNovelPractice

Making a Visual Novel Game with [Make A Visual Novel in Unity 2023 from Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGSox0FgA5B58Ki4t4VqAPDycEpmkBd0i).
Its purpose looks more focused on building a customed game engine system INSIDE Unity than making a game but/so I figured it would be nice to learn how to make a visual novel game from it.
This README file contains what I learned from the channel throughout the series.
